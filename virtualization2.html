  <h1> Virtualization</h1><br>
In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual(rather than actual) version of something.<br>
This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources. <hr>
<h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
<ol type="1">

<li><b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level </b></li> <br>

Every machine has an instruction set .This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.
Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.<br>

<br><li><b>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level </b></li>

</ol>

    In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.
<ul type="circle">

<li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
<li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.</li>
